Fork of [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) -- adds Drivechain
===================================================================================

This is a demo of what would need to be changed, in Bitcoin, to allow it to support sidechains.

<b>Do not test with existing wallet. Regtest mode suggested.</b>  
<i>Function receivesidechainwt creates a transaction automatically.</i>

See:

1. [Drivechains blog post](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/drivechain/) 
2. [Drivechains OP code](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/drivechain-op-code/)

Short-term goal: to send testnet BTC to [Hivemind](https://github.com/bitcoin-hivemind/hivemind) and use them in P2P markets.

Long-term goal: develop & test a pull request for Bitcoin Core, and get it merged.
